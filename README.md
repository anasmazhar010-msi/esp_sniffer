# esp_sniffer
An ESP sniffer is a network monitoring tool built on ESP32/ESP8266 that uses promiscuous mode to capture all nearby Wi-Fi packets, not just those addressed to it. This enables observation of traffic, device connections, and wireless activity, providing a low-cost, portable tool for diagnostics and analysis.
